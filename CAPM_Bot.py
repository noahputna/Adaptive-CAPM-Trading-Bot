CAPMBot: Adaptive CAPM-Based Trading Agent for Trading Simulation.

Description: This bot participates in a simulated marketplace using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
It evaluates the expected payoff and risk (variance) of each security and optimises trades using a 
mean-variance utility function. Includes features for risk aversion tuning, dynamic order handing,
and intelligen portfolio management.

This bot simulates a CAPM-based strategy in a trading evironment.
It dynamically assess whether to accept orders based on expected payoff penalised by variance.
It supports both proactive and reactive trading modes.
