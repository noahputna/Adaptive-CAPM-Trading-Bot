# Adaptive-CAPM-Trading-Bot
This project simulates a **CAPM-based trading bot** that adapts to market conditions using modern portfolio theory. It evaluates potential trades in real-time using **expected payoff penalised by variance**, mimicking the principles of risk-adjusted return optimisation.

Designed within an agent-based market simulation (Flexemarkets), the bot **engages in reacive market-making**
